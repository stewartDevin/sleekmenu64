"""What the browser reads and writes on the card, named in one place.

The console side has the same constants in src/card_paths.h and the two must
agree. One name rather than a literal in every file, and not for tidiness:
the library scan skips the browser's own folder by comparing against this
name, so renaming it everywhere but one place would leave the browser
listing its own catalog and cover pack as if they were games.

Renaming the project is a one-line change here and one in src/card_paths.h.
