"""Build the catalog's metadata JSON from a real ROM library.

Three sources, in order of how much they can be trusted:

  The ROM's own 64-byte header -- byte order, country, game code, CRC pair.
  These need no database and cannot be wrong about the file in front of them.

  data/coverdb.csv -- genre, publisher, year, players and the canonical name,
  keyed on that same header CRC pair, with the product code as the fallback
  for a dump it has never seen (tools/identify.py). Reviewed once and
  committed, so every card gets the same answer and a wrong one can be fixed
  for everybody.

  The metadata collection, when one is on the card: publisher, year and
  player count for games the database has never catalogued, and the
  description the browser shows on the details screen, all looked up by the
  game code the header carries (tools/metadata_repo.py).

Anything none of the three knows is left unset rather than guessed. A catalog
entry with year 0 or no genre is a game the browser simply cannot filter on --
the honest outcome for a hack, a homebrew build, or a translation that no
database has ever catalogued.

Output feeds tools/build_catalog.py unchanged.
