/* Everything the browser reads or writes on the card, derived from one name.

 * One name, not five literals, and not for tidiness: catalog.c excludes the
 * browser's own folder from the library scan by comparing against this
 * name, so a folder renamed in four places and missed in the fifth would
 * leave the browser listing its own catalog and cover pack as if they were
 * games. Deriving everything from SM_CARD_FOLDER makes that impossible, and
 * makes renaming the project a one-line change here and one in
 * tools/card_layout.py.
