/* One file for all the box art, with an index read once at startup.

   745 loose sprites in one directory is slower than it sounds. FatFs has no
   directory index, so opening one by name walks the directory from the start,
   and long filenames cost four or five 32-byte entries each -- well over
   100 KB of directory read before the first byte of a picture, and it was
   being paid twice per cover because existence was probed before the load.
   That is the pause between moving the cursor and the art appearing.

   Here the index is 16 bytes per cover, held in RAM, and a lookup is a binary
   search over sorted 64-bit name hashes followed by one seek. The file stays
   open for the session, so after startup a cover costs no directory work at
   all.

   Written by tools/cover_pack.py, which documents the layout. Only the header
   is checked here: the pack is ten megabytes and verifying its CRC at startup
   would cost more than every lookup it will ever serve. The catalog, at half a
   megabyte, is checked in full. */
